## 🌟 Overview

PINNACORE OS is a revolutionary decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) that allows users to monetize their device computing power by earning AJT tokens. Built in Lahti, Finland 🇫🇮

### The Story

Hundreds of sleepless nights. Scattered projects, endless lines of code.

**ThoughtMate** was born from the need for true decision intelligence.  
**AgentArmy** was created to eliminate time-consuming routines.  
**TurvaVault** emerged because my data belongs to me.  
**TurvaTalk** exists because privacy is a fundamental right.

For years, these lived separately. Until one night, everything clicked.

**I realized: these are not apps. They are layers. And layers form an ecosystem.**

An ecosystem becomes a living organism.

Unified into one architecture: **PINNACORE OS**.
